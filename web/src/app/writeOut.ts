// inflate workers, so a big one doesn't stop the page while it saves.

// A drawing's held parts are read from the file it was opened from. Saved over that file, they are
// read from the new one, where the save put them; a part the save didn't write (an object deleted
// and still in the undo history) is read into memory first, before the file it was in is replaced.
