// View > Multiple View Panes, as Vectorworks' multiple view panes: the drawing area as one pane, or as two,
// three or four, all drawn at once, each a plan or a 3D view. A new arrangement has the plan in the
// first (with three or four, the large one, on whichever side the arrangement puts it) and a 3D view
// in each of the others (Front, Right and an isometric view to start with). One pane is active,
// ringed in the accent: the render mode, the zoom and Fit act on it, as they act on the one view
// shown alone; Top/Plan, 3D View and the standard views make the pane of their kind the active one,
// turning the active pane into one only when no pane is. The live plan (drawing, editing) is in the
// plan pane last made active, and the live 3D view (orbiting, picking, walking) in the 3D pane last
// made active; every other pane shows the drawing from where its view was left, drawn again as it
// changes. A click in a pane showing a picture makes it the active one (that click does nothing
// else). Each pane has a chip in its corner naming what it shows, whose menu shows the plan or the
// 3D view there, turns it to a standard view or closes it. The dividers drag, a double-click on one
// shares the area evenly, and the arrangement is kept in this browser and with saved workspaces.
//
// View > Multiple View Panes has Vectorworks' commands too: Enable Multiple View Panes goes from
// one pane to the last arrangement of several and back; Split Horizontally and Split Vertically
// cut the active pane in two with a level or an upright divider, the new half showing what it
// showed; Close Active View Pane gives its room to its neighbours. They go as far as the
// arrangements above reach: four panes at most, and a row or column of three small panes splits
// no further. Create Floating View Pane opens one more view of the drawing, floating over it
// (floatingPanes.ts).
