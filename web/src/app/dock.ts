// Palettes: the panels beside the drawing, after Spline's side panels. Each
// sits in the left or right dock, a full-height column at that edge of the
// window, or floats anywhere over the drawing; its title bar drags it between them, and
// its buttons roll it up to its title or close it (the Window menu shows it
// again). Dropped on another palette's title bar, a palette becomes a tab of it;
// dragging a tab out of the title bar separates it again. Palettes that fill
// (Object Info, Navigation) share their dock's spare height, split by the
// handles between them; tool palettes keep their own height. A dock's palettes
// can also stand side by side, in columns, as Vectorworks docks them: while a
// palette is dragged, a docking guide over the docked palette under the pointer
// offers above, below, left and right of it (a new column) and its middle (a
// tab), a guide at each side of the drawing the end of that dock, and Option or
// Ctrl held keeps the palette floating. A right-click on a
// title bar offers the same moves. Along each dock's outer edge runs a rail of
// icons, one per palette of that side that is open, used every day (EVERYDAY) or
// opened before, then a More palettes button with the rest of that side's: a click
// shows a palette, brings its tab to the front or closes it, so every palette is a
// click or two away without taking room from the drawing. A dock folds to its
// rail, leaving the drawing all but the rail's width; an icon then opens its
// palette beside the rail, over the drawing, until the next click elsewhere. The
// arrangement, with the interface's density (Window > Compact Interface), is kept
// in localStorage, per browser. A window narrower than the touch layout's puts the
// palettes away for that visit only (awayForVisit): the arrangement kept stays the
// wider window's.
//
// Window > View Bar Options shows the View bar in its regular size, compact (tighter, without the
// layer's scale) or auto-hidden (out of sight till the pointer comes near it), with or without
// captions over its groups. Window > Palette Options auto-hides the docked palettes (both docks
// folded to their rails, a palette sliding out from its icon) or the floating ones (each rolled up
// to its title bar while the pointer is elsewhere).
//
// On a phone (560 px wide or less) there are no docks: one palette at a time comes up as a
// bottom sheet over the foot of the drawing, which is cut short to stand above it. The sheet's
// title lists the palettes to switch to, and its grip sets its height: 30, 55 or 90 per cent of
// the window.
