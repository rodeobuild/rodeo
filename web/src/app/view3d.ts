// 3D view: the design layers' objects as a WebGL scene (three.js), z up, in world
// millimetres. Objects are merged into one geometry per colour, opacity and texture,
// and into one edge set per colour, so a model of millions of triangles is a few draw
// calls. Each merged array keeps the runs of triangles (or segments) that belong to
// each object: a click maps the hit triangle back to its object, and layer visibility
// rewrites the index buffers. The scene is drawn on demand (camera moves, resizes,
// edits), never in a loop. The Visualization palette's settings (heliodon.ts) choose a
// perspective or orthogonal camera, where the sun stands and whether it casts shadows,
// and the clip cube that cuts the model open; View > Rendering's options how Shaded draws
// (textures, colours, edges, shadows on the ground only, their quality) and the dashes of
// Dashed Hidden Line. The selected objects are drawn over the model in the selection's colour
// (setSelected).
