// Vectorworks keeps every solid (extrude 24, solid addition/subtraction 84,
// multiple extrude 38, sweep 34, generic solid 113 via its NURBS child 111,
// roof face 71, the bodies of walls and plug-in objects, ...) as a Parasolid
// body in a type-114 child. Next to the Parasolid transmit data the record
// holds the body's edges, already tessellated:
//   +0x5a  16 x (u16 id, u32 offset), offsets counted from +0x60; entry 0 is
//          (number of sections, end offset), unused entries have id 0xffff
//   section 0   points: 3 x f64 (x, y, z) each, in the owner's own frame for extrudes and
//               sweeps, in its parent's for multiple extrudes and solid additions
//   section 13  curves: 6-byte entries (u16 point count, u32 first point)
//   section 14  straight edges: same layout, two points each
//   section 19  the Parasolid transmit file (binary XT); read only where the
//               edges don't make all the faces, and then meshed by cadmpeg (parasolid.ts)
// Faces are not cached, so they are rebuilt from the edges: every plane that
// two edges at a vertex span collects the edges lying in it, the planar graph
// of those edges gives its bounded faces, and nesting decides which are solid
// (even depth) and which are holes. Curved side faces come from pairs of
// curves that are translated copies of each other (extrusions). A round body
// whose edges are only meridians from one pole to another and rings round them
// (an existing tree's canopy) is swept round its axis (meridianFaces). Other
// faces whose boundary is not planar (free-form surfaces) come from section 19
// once it is decoded, and show as edges only until then.
//
// Site models (the "DTM6" plug-in) cache only their bounding box as a body;
// the terrain is in their aux records (76, tag at +0x50 as stored):
//   "pNIT"  u32 version at +0x54, then points from +0x58: x, y, z as f64 and
//           8 more bytes (32 per point), or 16 more (40: two u32 flags and a
//           second height) in newer site models
//   "eNIT"  one f64 per point from +0x58, which gives the point count
//   "tNIT"  u32 version at +0x54, then 51-byte triangles from +0x58: three
//           i64 point indices, three i64 neighbour triangles (-1 none), 3 flags
// ("DMT" records beside them hold a 2D topology without heights.) Hardscapes,
// landscape areas and site modifiers keep a TIN too, flat near 0 where the
// drawing's terrain lies far above it; they show their own parts, draped.
//
// A plug-in object's profile group (a group tagged "gorp") holds what it is
// rebuilt from, not what it shows: a plant's symbol at 0 while the plant
// stands on the terrain, a plant symbol's image prop at its own size beside
// the copy at the plant's height, a door's handle at its origin, an
// assembly's frames.
// A hardscape's or landscape area's path draped on the terrain (a group with a
// TDMD of kind "htap") is its boundary, a few corners left at 0 where draping
// failed. Both are left out; the objects show their own parts. So is a
// selection group (tagged "gles": a copy of what it shows, or a box round it,
// which Vectorworks doesn't draw) where the plug-in shows something else.
//
// Textures: an object's RenderWorks texture is a "TDMD" aux record (76) whose
// 4CC at +0x56 is "ttwr". TDMD records are typed dictionaries: u16 count at
// +0x5a, u32 end at +0x5c, then (u16 key, u32 offset) entries from +0x60,
// offsets counted from +0x60; each value is u16 type (8 i32, 1 byte, 6 f64),
// u32 count (one per texture part), then the values. In "ttwr", key 3 is the
// texture's name index (-1 none, 0 the class's texture), key 5 the mapping
// and keys 6/7 its offset, scale, rotation and matrix. "By class" takes the
// texture whose name index is the i32 at +0x9e of the class record (0 none).
// An object without its own texture takes the one of the object it belongs to.
// A mesh that maps its texture by UV (Laubwerk plants) gives that texture a part
// of its own with mapping 5 (its whole-object part has none), and keeps the map
// in a TDMD of kind "TeMe" (its 4CC reads "eMeT"): key 1 a normal per vertex
// (3 f64), key 2 (u, v) per vertex (2 f64, v up). A 3D polygon mapped by plane
// (0: image props) places the image in the polygon's own frame: from its first
// vertex, x along its first edge, z up its face and y against its normal; key 7
// gives the image's u and v axes and its origin there, and the image spans the
// texture's size x the part's scale across, in proportion up (key 6). An image
// prop is mapped 6, and a panel of it with no texture of its own shows its
// image once across and up the panel, in that same frame (not one tile of the
// texture's size, an inch for most props).
//
// Colours: untextured faces show their fill as Top/Plan paints it, with the
// class's attributes where the object takes them by class: a solid or bitmap
// fill its background colour, a hatch its own ground (the fill background of
// a hatch-filled object is not drawn, and is often black), a gradient its
// middle stop. No fill shows a neutral grey.
//
// Walls (68) hold their 3D twice: a group (11) of bodies, one solid per
// component plus zero-thickness planes on the component faces, and one solid
// addition (84) per component carrying that component's fill, class and
// texture. The solids are the same triangles, so only the components are
// drawn (both would fight for the same pixels); the group serves walls
// without component solids. Doors, windows and cabinets often have a face
// lying exactly on a wall's face; the wall's faces are marked recessed, so
// the 3D view draws them a hair behind and the object in front wins.
//
// Frames: extrudes, solids, multiple extrudes and sweeps (24, 84, 38, 34) map
// their body to the parent's frame by a 3x3 matrix at +0xcc (three rows: the
// images of the x, y and z axes) and an offset at +0x114. Symbol instances
// (15) do the same with their matrix at +0x96, and plug-in objects (86) with
// theirs at +0xf0 for everything they hold; a design-layer viewport (a
// plug-in, model.ts dlvpShows) places the layers it shows by its own. A design
// layer's elevation is not added: objects are saved at their height in the
// model, the layer's elevation already in it. An extrude saved without a body (most plug-in
// objects' parts) sweeps its profile over its 3D box's z range (+0x9c: x1 y1
// z1 x0 y0 z0, in its own frame). 3D polygons (25) list their vertices directly: u16 count at
// +0xd0, then (x, y, z) f64 triples from +0xd2; +0x8d is 1 when closed. Open
// ones (contour lines) are edges only.
