# rvt-rs (vendored build)

The WebAssembly build of [rvt-rs](https://github.com/DrunkOnJava/rvt-rs), an open-source,
clean-room reader for Revit files (Apache-2.0; licence and notice in
`public/licences/rvt-rs.txt`, linked from Help > About). `src/import/rvtModel.ts` reads a Revit
model's levels, elements, geometry and parameters with it, in the import's worker
(`src/app/revitImport.worker.ts`) in the browser and directly under Node in the checks.

- Version: v0.15.0 (commit 0945d5a3), `rvt-wasm` crate, release profile, no wasm-opt.
- Patched with `scripts/rvt-wasm.patch`: `savedMeshes` also takes `"all"` (every element rvt-rs has
  only as its record's box drawn from the mesh Revit saved for display, as
  `rvt-ifc --saved-meshes`), and `familyExtrusions: true` is `rvt-ifc --family-extrusions`. It also
  reads saved graphics on Revit 2015 to 2022 files (upstream: 2023 to 2027), follows an external
  symbol whose `m_GRepId` is absent (Revit 2022 stairs and columns), and offers a family instance
  drawn as its turned box (RE-87) its saved mesh too. It treats a flip control (GBiFlipControl) as
  holding no surface, takes a railing's saved mesh only where it fills its box, tolerates a curved
  edge whose fixed parameter drifts, and meshes ruled faces between arc, ellipse and Hermite
  profiles, refusing (keeping the box) one whose edges disagree with its neighbours by more than
  0.003 ft or which doesn't fill its box (one short axis allowed where the owner left out parts
  Revit hides in 3D, if no triangle spans more than half the box, a flat triangle lying parallel
  to a side of the box excepted). Trimmed faces mesh inside their boundary loops; where the interior lattice can't meet the
  chord tolerance, or the face has holes, a constrained Delaunay triangulation refined inside
  the boundary (never splitting it) does. An element still boxed because a trim loop's
  corners miss by up to 1e-3 ft is decoded once more with that join, and with a ruled surface's
  point end read as its apex, islands meshed beside the outline, and constraints recovered by
  cavity retriangulation; on that pass a boundary chord too coarse for the tolerance is split at one point on the shared edge in both faces, and a curved edge may sit up to 1e-4 ft off the plane beside it; it also reads Hermite surfaces (bicubic patches), meshed inside their trim loops, and joins model-space trim loops within 1e-3 ft. The retry also takes a trim edge the triangulation can't recover, splits a shared edge against a flat neighbour (the plane's outline takes the same point), and reads a turned element's lines in its own frame, where they may complete any axis of its box (one short axis may stay open for parts Revit hides, and a strip lying along one axis, such as a moulding, doesn't count as spanning the box). A curved shell the retry still refuses for open edges is decoded a third time with its ruled faces gridded in bands along their twist, rows never closer than the display tolerance, and only each face's boundary vertices joined in the rim test. The retry is kept only where the element then passes every check. An element with
  up to four faces (at most a tenth) that did not decode is drawn from the rest where they fill its
  box on every axis with no triangle spanning it; railings excepted. A railing's top rail and handrails, which Revit keeps as a profile and a
  path with no faces, are swept from their own records: the profile family's loop (lines, arcs or
  ellipses) along the path, which already holds the rail's extensions and offset; mitred where it
  bends, or rounded to the type's fillet radius where its type joins rails with fillets; capped at
  its ends; along an upright return or floor extension, only a profile centred on the path. Only
  rails placed exactly are swept, with profiles symmetric about their y axis and no joins set rail
  by rail. A railing drawn from its saved mesh gets its rails where all of them sweep and the whole
  stays in its box. A railing whose mesh doesn't fill its box is tried once more with them, and
  kept where the whole fills its box or ends at the top its records give it (the top of its path
  plus its type's highest rail).
